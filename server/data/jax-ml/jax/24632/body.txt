Do some reorganization of the docs with the goals of:
- keeping a linear tutorial flow, visiting certain topics multiple times to build up understanding
- deduplicating material
- removing the “User guides” and “Advanced guides” sections and work the material into the tutorials

Tasks are:

- [ ] Merge How to Think in JAX with Key Concepts into a new intro section
- [x] Split “Control flow” out of Sharp Bits into its own tutorial
  - [x] Add an example for logical operators to the Control Flow tutorial 
- [ ] Other changes to Sharp Bits
    - [x] Remove or cut down parts on PRNG/NaNs since these are handled elsewhere
    - [x] Move the discussion of jitting class methods from FAQ to Sharp Bits
    - [ ] Add a note about not jitting functions that close over large arrays
- [ ] New tutorial on Tracing (drawing from “How to Think in JAX” and “Different Kinds of JAX Values” in the FAQ)
- [x] Add an example with register_dataclasses to the pytrees tutorial
- [ ] Move “Controlling data and computation placement on devices” from FAQ to Intro to parallel programming
- [ ] Split “Custom Pytrees” off of the pytrees tutorial and into its own Advanced section
- [ ] Split up Advanced AD into sections
- [ ] Reorganize the User Guides and Advanced Guides into “Getting Started > Tutorials” and “Resources and Advanced Tutorials”
- [ ] Move “Buffer donation” from FAQ to a new section under “Performance optimizations”
- [ ] Move “Benchmarking” from FAQ to a new section under “Performance benchmarking and profiling”
- [ ] Remove material from “Parallel Computation” that overlaps with “Introduction to Parallel Programming”
